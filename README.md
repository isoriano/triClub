# TriClub - Learning project

This project is implemented using:

- [Angular 12](https://angular.io)
- [Nx](https://nx.dev).
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)
- [Module Federation](https://github.com/angular-architects/module-federation-plugin/blob/main/packages/mf/tutorial/tutorial.md)

The Goal behind it is to use a "real" project to learn different technologies and ideas. At the moment of this writing the project is being build using a micro-frontend architecture, boostrap and angular material for the styling and using firebase for authentication, storing information and for deployment.
